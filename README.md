# PowerTrain-s-Railroad-Related-E2-Pack
This is a comprehensive pack of several E2's for Garry's Mod which I have either created or modified and optimized from existing public E2's. These E2's are intended for use on train build servers and require Wiremod to function. Several other model packs which can be found on the steam workshop also required.
You might as well subscribe to my server collection, rverything you need (aside from wiremod) will be in there.
